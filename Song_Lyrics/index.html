                    <p>I'm sorry but
                        Don't wanna talk, I need a moment before I go
                        It's nothing personal
                        I draw the blinds
                        They don't need to see me cry
                        'Cause even if they understand
                        They don't understand
                        So then when I'm finished</p>

                    <p>I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
                        I'm taking my misery
                        Make it my bitch; can't be everyone's favorite girl</p>

                    <p>So take aim and fire away
                        I've never been so wide awake
                        No, nobody but me can keep me safe
                        And I'm on my way
                        The blood moon is on the rise
                        The firе burning in my eyes
                        No, nobody but me can keep mе safe
                        And I'm on my way</p>

                        Because by your side I realized that I am nothing
                        And I got tired of fighting and fighting in vain
                        To be in the line of fire and to reach out
                        I accept my mistakes, I am also human
                        And you don't see that I do it because I love you (Pu-pu-pu-pum)</p>
